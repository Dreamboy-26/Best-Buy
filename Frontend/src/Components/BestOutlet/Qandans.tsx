        Save big money on the latest tech by shopping Best Buy’s Outlet Centre
      </h1>
      <h2>Why Shop the Best Buy Outlet?</h2>
      <p>
        Everybody loves the deals and savings you can find at an outlet store,
        but the selection of high-demand items like laptops and TVs is often
        low, and you don’t always know what you’re getting.
        <br />
        With the Best Buy Outlet Centre, you’ll find a vast selection of
        in-demand products that only Canada’s largest consumer electronics
        retailer can offer: laptops, TVs, tablets, headphones, and major
        appliances— you name it! You’ll not only find the biggest selection of
        products all in one place, you’ll also have multiple options to choose
        from: clearance, refurbished, open box, and Geek Squad Certified Open
        Box.
        <br /> All Best Buy Outlet products come with big savings, as well as a
        warranty ranging from a minimum of 90 days to the full manufacturer’s
        warranty. Learn more about our return policies at Best Buy Canada.

      <h2>Clearence</h2>
      <p>
        Clearance sales may just be the best way to get incredible savings on
        the products you’ve been wanting. Choose from a huge selection of
        products ranging from PCs, to home audio gear, furniture, and even major
        appliances. What two things do these all have in common? Spectacular
        savings, and limited quantities— once they’re gone, they’re gone for
        good. Clearance products carry their full manufacturer’s warranty, and
        they offer the same no-hassle returns as any other new item. You also
        have the option of supplementing that warranty with a Geek Squad
        Protection plan, which will give you additional peace of mind.
      </p>
      <h2> Open box products Open box</h2>
      <p>
        is a great option to save money on everything, from TVs to laptops. Best
        Buy Canada also offers open box appliances, which are a budget-friendly
        option when it’s time to update your kitchen. All open box products are
        in like-new condition. They include all the original accessories and are
        covered by a minimum six-month warranty. Each item has been fully
        inspected, tested, and verified to be working perfectly.
      </p>
      <h2> Geek Squad Certified Open Box products with full warranty</h2>
      <p>
        What has even better value than open box? Geek Squad Certified Open Box
        products, which include a full warranty.
        <br />
        Savings don’t get much better than this. Geek Squad experts examine each
        of these open box items carefully, ensuring they are in mint condition
        and fully functional. All original accessories from the manufacturer are
        also included in the box. Only products that pass inspection with flying
        colours earn the Geek Squad certification. These products include full
        warranty coverage, plus the ability to return them if you change your
        mind. Go with Geek Squad Certified for products, like open box laptops,
        that are good as new, never refurbished, include a full warranty, and
        offer incredible savings.

        Refurbished products
      </p>
      <h2>Refurbished products</h2>
      <p>
        {" "}
        Refurbished products from Best Buy Outlet are a great way to save big on
        newer technology. Qualified Marketplace partners take returned
        merchandise and put it through a detailed refurbishment process. While
        there may be minor cosmetic imperfections (many are like-new, though),
        these products function perfectly. They are fully inspected, include all
        accessories required for operation, and come with a minimum 90-day
        warranty. <br />
        Savings are incredible. A refurbished laptop or refurbished MacBook is a
        fraction of the price of a new one, but delivers the same performance
        and user experience. Why wait to set money aside for a new iPad, when
        you could be enjoying a much more affordable refurbished iPad now?
        Refurbished computers and tablets deliver modern performance at prices
        so low that you’ll have plenty of money left over to stock up on
        additional accessories and peripherals.
